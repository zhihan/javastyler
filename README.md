# Java Styler

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zhihan/minisat-scala.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zhihan/javastyler)

This is a simple command-line tool that checks the style of your Java source files. It has a number of built-in rules that originates from https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html 

Having a standard style is a very good practice, but some of the styles, such as the ones related to whitespace, is tedious and very easy to miss. This tool helps Java developers to find style problems and fix them automatically.
